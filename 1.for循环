>>> for magician in magicians:
	print(magician)

alice
david
carolina

有关第一行代码的名称，建议才用单数和复数名称，用以区别。
比如
for cat in cats:
for dog in dogs:
for item in list_of_items:

代码进化版

>>> magicians=['alice','david','carolina']
>>> for magician in magicians:
	print(magician.title()+", that was a great trick!"+"\n"+"I can not wait to see your next trick!\n")

	
Alice, that was a great trick!
I can not wait to see your next trick!

David, that was a great trick!
I can not wait to see your next trick!

Carolina, that was a great trick!
I can not wait to see your next trick!

for后面，没有缩进的代码只执行一次。（这个要在文档里面弄好后再运行，直接编译器里不行）
magicians=['alice','david','carolina']
for magician in magicians:
    print(magician.title()+", I like your show so much!")
print("Thank you all.")

Alice, I like your show so much!
David, I like your show so much!
Carolina, I like your show so much!
Thank you all.
